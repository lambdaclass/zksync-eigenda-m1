The sidecar is composed of three running components, a [metrics endpoint](./metrics-endpoints/metrics.md), a [proof request receiver](./proof-request-receiver/proof-request-receiver.md), and a [proof generator](./proof-generator/proof-generator.md). 

It contains some [docker services](./docker-services/docker-services.md) and uses [RiscZero to generate the groth16 proofs](./groth16-proof-generation/groth16-proof-generation.md).
